</p>
<p>
    The My Goals section of the Performance Development Platform is intended to be a flexible environment that allows employees and supervisors to create 
    and track goals in a way that works best for their team. Employees and supervisors can set work, learning, or career development goals and track progress. 
    Goals stay in the system until they are completed, put on hold or withdrawn which lets you create long- and short-term goals.

</p>
<p>
    The Performance Development Platform supports employees and supervisors to have the right conversation at the right time. The My Conversations section 
    of the Performance Development Platform is where employees and supervisors record and sign off on performance conversations every 4 months. 
    This is also where you can find the templates to support your conversations including onboarding a new employee, goal setting, career development, 
    performance check-ins or performance improvement.

    The My Team section of the Performance Development Platform provides supervisors a dashboard of direct report details and access to their profiles

    been shared or excused in the PDP.
