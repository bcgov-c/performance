<!-- <p><strong>Elements of effective goals(the Five C&rsquo;s)</strong></p> -->
<!-- <p>The types of goals we set and how we frame them influence how well they motivate us and how likely we are to achieve them. To maximize effectiveness, we should <strong>c</strong>ollaborate with our supervisor to set <strong>c</strong>lear, <strong>c</strong>hallenging goals and <strong>c</strong>ommit ourselves to following through on them while recognizing when a <strong>c</strong>omplex goal may need to be broken it into smaller more manageable chunks. Details of this &ldquo;Five Cs&rdquo; approach are shown below.</p> -->
<p>Creating S-M-A-R-T goals help ensure that our objectives are clearly defined and attainable within an agreed upon timeframe. Making those goals H-A-R-D increases our level of focus and motivation.</p>
