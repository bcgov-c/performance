<p><strong>Elements of effective goals(the Five C&rsquo;s)</strong></p>
<p>The types of goals we set and how we frame them influence how well they motivate us and how likely we are to achieve them. To maximize effectiveness, we should <strong>c</strong>ollaborate with our supervisor to set <strong>c</strong>lear, <strong>c</strong>hallenging goals and <strong>c</strong>ommit ourselves to following through on them while recognizing when a <strong>c</strong>omplex goal may need to be broken it into smaller more manageable chunks. Details of this &ldquo;Five Cs&rdquo; approach are shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
</td>

<p>Use the SMART framework to help clarify important elements of your goals. Goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong>pecific: well-defined and easily understood</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>easurable: associated with objective measures that define what success looks like</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>chievable: attainable with realistic effort and available resources</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>elevant: beneficial/valuable and connected to your organization&rsquo;s strategy</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound: driven by ambitious but realistic timelines</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
</td>

<p>Achievable does not mean easy. Be willing to challenge yourself and leave your comfort zone. Lean in to being uncomfortable; that&rsquo;s where the magic happens.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You need to be committed to the goal for it to be effective. Try to find a way to connect with it emotionally &ndash; what does it mean to succeed? What is the impact? If you can visualize success, you will feel more committed to achieving your goal.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Setting goals should be a collaborative process between you and your supervisor. You will be more engaged if you play a role in goal setting and have ongoing conversations with your supervisor about how things are going.</p>

<p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
</td>

<p>We all deal with complexity in different ways. If a goal is overwhelming, break it down into more manageable sub-goals to keep yourself motivated.</p>
