<li><em>(What)</em> I want to move into a position more focused on policy creation (<em>Why</em>) so that I can take advantage of my formal education and interest in the area. (<em>How</em>) I will reach out to managers in policy shops across the BCPS to introduce myself and request meetings to discuss my interests and explore opportunities to join their team, and I will apply on any policy-related temporary assignments that will help me increase my government-specific experience. (<em>Measure</em>) I will be successful if I have participated in a policy project by end of year and if I have moved into a permanent policy position within three years.</li>
