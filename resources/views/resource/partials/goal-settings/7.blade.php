<li><em>(What)</em> I want to move into a role focused on facilitating engagement with remote communities throughout BC <em>(Why)</em> to ensure every citizen in BC has an opportunity to be heard. <em>(How)</em> I will do this by developing and practicing my facilitation skills with various groups, learning about the relevant interests and issues of remote communities in BC, and applying for related facilitation positions as they arise. <em>(Measure)</em> I will be successful if I attain a Community Facilitator role within four years and increase the degree of consultation with members in remote communities on future government-related projects.</li>

<li><em>(What)</em> I want to move into a position more focused on policy creation <em>(Why)</em> so that I can take advantage of my formal education and interest in the area. <em>(How)</em> I will reach out to managers in policy shops across the BCPS to introduce myself, request meetings to discuss my interests, explore opportunities to join their team, and I will apply for policy-related temporary assignments that could help me increase my government-specific experience. <em>(Measure)</em> I will be successful if I have participated in a policy project by end of year and if I have moved into a permanent policy position within three years.</li>
