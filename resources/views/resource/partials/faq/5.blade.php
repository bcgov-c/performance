Navigate to My Goals > Goal Bank > Team Goal Bank and click the button to “Add Goal to Bank”. You create a goal here just as you would for yourself 
and then select team members to push the goal out to in the “Audience” drop-down. You can include yourself in the audience if you’d also like to see 
the goal appear in your own goal bank.

This option creates a separate copy of the goal for each user that copies it from the goal bank. This means that you can add different comments 
to each team member’s version of the goal, and the goal status can be changed to achieved or archived for each team member individually without 
impacting the other users.

You can remove a goal from your team’s goal bank by navigating to My Goals > Goal Bank > Team Goal Bank and deleting the entry. 
This will remove it from all team members Goal Banks as well. Note that, if someone has already copied the goal into their own profile, 
they will keep their version of the goal even if you delete the original from the Goal Bank.
