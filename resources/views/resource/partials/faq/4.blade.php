The My Conversations section is designed to support employees and supervisors to have the right conversation at the right time. 
The topic of each performance conversation does not have to be the same. The PDP has templates to support conversations focused on onboarding a new employee, 
goal setting, performance check-ins, career development, and performance improvement. Each of these count as a performance conversation.
</p>
<p>
To request a conversation with your employee / supervisor, navigate to My Conversations > Conversation Templates. 
Select the template that best matches the conversation you’d like to have, select the appropriate person from the participants drop-down menu, 
and click “Start Conversation”. This will send a notification to the other person that you would like to meet and will create a conversation file 
on your “Open Conversations” tab under either the “Open Conversations with my Supervisor” or “Open Conversations with my Team” heading.
</p>
<p>
Note that the conversation will still need to be scheduled independently in your Outlook calendar at a time that works for both you and your supervisor. 
There is no direct connection between PDP and Outlook calendar.
