Reporting relationship data is pulled from PeopleSoft (our HR system of record) once every 24 hours. This data cannot be modified in the PDP.
</p>
<p>
If you want to add a shared supervisor for an employee in the PDP, you can have the current supervisor share the employee by clicking on the 
Yes / No under the “Shared” column on their My Team page.
</p>
<p>
If the data in PeopleSoft is incorrect, you will need to submit a service request through AskMyHR using the category 
HR Software Systems Support > Position / Reporting Updates.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Employees that report to a position number in PeopleSoft that is vacant are automatically assigned one level higher in the organization hierarchy. 
If that next level is also vacant, the employee will see on their home page that their current supervisor is “No supervisor”.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Employees that report to a position number in PeopleSoft that has more than one active employee associated with it 
(“double-bunked” positions) will see a dropdown menu on their homepage that allows them to select which of the supervisors associated with the position number 
is correct for them.

<p>
If a supervisor shares a position number with one or more additional employees in PeopleSoft (i.e. the supervisor is “double-bunked” in their position) 
they may not see the correct employees by default. In this case, their employees will be able to select the correct supervisor from a dropdown menu 
on the homepage under the “Current supervisor” heading. Once the employee has made the selection, the supervisor will gain access to that employee in the PDP.
