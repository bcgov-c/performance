There are two ways to include a goal in your PDP profile. You can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new goal using the “Create New Goal” function; or</li>
    <li>Import a goal that has been assigned to you by your supervisor or organization using the “Add Goal from Goal Bank” function.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you launch the “Create New Goal” screen, you will be asked to select a goal type, goal title, and goal tags to help you identify and sort your goals. 
All three sections are mandatory. You can access more detailed information on these sections by clicking on the information “i” icon next to each heading in the app. 
There are best practice tips to set effective goals available in the <a href="/resources/goal-setting" target="_blank" >goal setting section</a> of the app.

The second way to include a goal in your PDP profile is to import a goal from your Goal Bank. 
This is a list of goals created for you by your supervisor or organization. Some goals will be marked as mandatory, 
but most are suggested starting points for you to consider. You can click on a goal to view the details and add it to your own profile. 
If needed, you can edit the goal to personalize it once it is in your profile.
