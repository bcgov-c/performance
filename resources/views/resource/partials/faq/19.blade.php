When an employee disagrees with the supervisor’s comments and/or assessment, the employee has the option to check off this box when 
signing off on the conversation.

<p>
This is another opportunity for the supervisor and employee to discuss the employee’s perspective so that the supervisor can seek to understand and 
consider the employee’s concerns and reasons for disagreeing with the conversation.

The <a href="/resources/conversations" target="_blank">Conversations Resources</a> area of the PDP can support you in this discussion. You may find the sections on “Asking for Feedback/Inquiring Into the 
Other’s Perspective” and “Addressing a Performance Issue” particularly helpful.
