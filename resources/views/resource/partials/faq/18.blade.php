The supervisor will be notified by email and a note will be added to their PDP homepage. The disagreement is registered in the system and 
will be visible when a report is run by the employee’s ministry or PSA. In addition to clicking the “disagree” option, the employee must still 
sign-off the conversation using their employee ID to complete the process.
