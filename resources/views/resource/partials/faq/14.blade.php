    During consultations, we heard from employees and supervisors that ratings were a major source of stress and not helpful in 
    improving performance or guiding career development.

    Performance development is focused on looking forward to improve future outcomes rather than looking backward to grade past accomplishments.

    Performance development is designed to encourage regular conversations between an employee and supervisor rather than focus 
    on an end-of-year rating conversation.

    The use of templates to support conversations focused on appreciation, coaching and evaluation allow us to recognize strong
