    During consultations, we heard from employees and supervisors that ratings were a major source of stress and not helpful in 
    improving performance or guiding career development.

    Performance development is focused on looking forward to improve future outcomes rather than looking backward to grade past accomplishments.

<li>
    Performance development is designed to encourage regular conversations between an employee and supervisor rather than focus 
    on an end-of-year rating conversation.

    The use of templates to support conversations focused on appreciation, coaching and evaluation allow us to recognize strong 
    performance and support performance improvement without the use of ratings.

    The BC Public Service did not regularly use information MyPerformance ratings to guide talent and compensation decisions.

        <li>
            Ratings were not a valid source of evidence to inform these decisions as they were distributed unequally and inequitably 
            across organizations, job types, and employee groups.
        </li>
        <li>
            There was always an additional step outside of the MyPerformance rating in the talent or compensation process used to evaluate candidates.
