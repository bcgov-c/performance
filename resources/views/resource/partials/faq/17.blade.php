<p>
There are supports offered in the PDP to help address different stages of performance concerns through targeted conversations and goal setting. 
At any stage, you can reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR for additional support in having these conversations. 
You may also consider requesting short term coaching to review how you want to show up in the conversation.

<p>
If performance concerns are just starting to emerge or are not deemed significant, you will want to use the “Coaching” and “Action Items” 
areas of the Performance Check-In template. This documents that you began the conversation with the employee, offered support and coaching, 
and agreed on relevant follow-up actions. You are still free to use other sections of the template to celebrate successes or 
document additional aspects of performance discussions.
</p>

<p>
If performance concerns are significant or persist over time, you will want to progress to the Performance Improvement template. 
This template is more explicit in identifying performance issues, supports to be provided, and timelines for meeting agreed improvement measures.
</p>

<p>
If performance improvements are not made within agreed upon timelines, you should reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR. The information that you 
have recorded in the PDP will provide important context and evidence to support the process as it is escalated.

You can also check out the section on “Addressing a Performance Issue” in the <a href="/resources/conversations" target="_blank">Conversations Resource section</a> of the PDP for additional assistance.
