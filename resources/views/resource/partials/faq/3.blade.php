Sharing a goal with a colleague is easy to do. Navigate to your My Current Goals page and locate the goal that you want to share. 
Click on the drop-down list under the “Shared With” heading, type in the name of your colleague, and save your selection. 
You can repeat this process to add additional colleagues to the goal.
</p>
<p>
The colleagues you selected will now see your goal on the tab “Goals Shared with Me”. They will be able to access the goal and add comments.
</p>
<p>
If needed, you can remove a colleague from your goal by going back to the “Shared With” drop-down and clicking “x” next to their name.
</p>
<p>
The person that originally created the goal will be able to change the goal status and mark it as achieved or archived on behalf of the group. 
This will move the goal to the Past Goals tab for all users with access to the goal.
