As a supervisor, you have access to a My Team page that has info about your direct and shared reports. 
Here you can find a summary view of how many active goals each employee has, when their next performance conversation is due, 
and whether or not they have been shared or excused in the PDP.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the next conversation due date is calculated by the PDP as part of an overnight background process. 
That means that an employee’s due date will not be updated to reflect a signed-off conversation until the day after sign-off is complete.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on an employee’s name will take you to their profile where you can view the details of their goals and conversations. 
You can add comments to their goals or any open conversations right in their profile.
</p>
<p>
You will see a banner across the top of the page letting you know when you are viewing an employee’s profile. 
To return to your own profile at any time, click the “Return to my profile” button in the top right corner. 
Clicking “back” in your web browser could cause log-in issues, so please use the “Return to my profile” option instead.
