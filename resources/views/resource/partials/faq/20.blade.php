The <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/managers-supervisors/employee-labour-relations/conditions-agreements/accountability-framework" target="_blank">Accountability Framework for Human Resource Management</a> requires that all supervisors in the BC Public Service:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Organize, direct and manage the performance of staff to meet operational requirements; and</li>
<li>Provide regular on-going feedback to their employees on their performance and support employees’ career paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The performance development process requires employees to have one conversation with their supervisor every four 
months (three per year) to meet these supervisor accountabilities.
</p>

<p>
In addition, performance conversations are a rewarding investment of time.
</p>

<ul>
<li>They are foundational to the strength of employee-supervisor relationships. These relationships are integral to attracting, developing, and retaining talent.</li>
<li>They provide clarity to the employee on what is expected of them and insights to the supervisor about what’s important to each employee and what motivates them.</li>
</ul>
