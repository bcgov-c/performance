You will not lose access to your past MyPerformance files. The MyPerformance system will remain online during the transition to 
performance development and the PDP. Once that transition is complete, the MyPerformance files will be made available to you in a secure archive. 
You cannot copy MyPerformance profiles directly into the PDP, though you can copy and paste any relevant text into the new format.

Sign-off by both parties in MyPerformance is required for the profile to be archived and made available.
