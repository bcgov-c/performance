<li>Signs-off on a performance conversation with you</li>
<li>Disagrees with the content of a performance conversation with you</li>
</ul>

<p>
And also:
</p>

<ul>
<li>One month before your next conversation due date</li>
<li>One week before your next conversation due date</li>
<li>When your conversation is past due</li>
