<h5>a. Why is performance development important?</h5>
<p>Performance development serves a range of functions that promote employee performance and career growth and organizational competitiveness, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Supporting skill development and career planning</li>
    <li>Aligning individual goals with organizational goals</li>
    <li>Increasing individual and organizational accountability</li>
    <li>Recognizing and rewarding good performance and managing underperformance</li>
    <li>Identifying and developing the necessary capabilities for an effective workforce</li>
    <li>Increasing productivity</li>
    <li>Building employee engagement.</li>
</ul><br>
<h5>b. How often do I need to have performance conversations?</h5>
<p>The Performance Development process requires employees to have one conversation with their supervisor every four months (three per year). The old MyPerformance system also required three conversations per year (Planning, Focusing and Sign-Off). There has been no change to this requirement.</p>
<br>
<h5>c. I am a supervisor and I don&rsquo;t have enough time. Why do I need to do this?</h5>
The <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/managers-supervisors/employee-labour-relations/conditions-agreements/accountability-framework" target=\'_blank\'>Accountability Framework for Human Resource Management</a> requires that all supervisors in the BC Public Service:
<ul>
    <li>Organize, direct and manage the performance of staff to meet operational requirements; and</li>
    <li>Provide regular on-going feedback to their employees on their performance and support employees&rsquo; career paths.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance development process requires employees to have one conversation with their supervisor every four months (three per year) to meet the supervisor accountabilities.</p>
<p>Performance conversations are also a rewarding investment of time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are foundational to the strength of employee-supervisor relationships. These relationships are integral to attracting, developing, and retaining talent.</li> 
    <li>They provide clarity to the employee on what is expected of them and insights to the supervisor about what&rsquo;s important to each employee and what motivates them.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>d. Why are there no ratings in the new approach to performance development?</h5>
<ul>
    <li>During consultations, we heard from employees and supervisors that ratings were a major source of stress and not helpful in improving performance or guiding career development.</li>
    <li>Performance development is focused on looking forward to improve future outcomes rather than looking backward to grade past accomplishments.</li>
    <li>Performance development is designed to encourage regular conversations between an employee and supervisor rather than focus on an end-of-year rating conversation. </li>
    <li>The use of templates to support conversations focused on appreciation, coaching and evaluation allow us to recognize strong performance and support performance improvement without the use of ratings.</li>
    <li>The BC Public Service did not regularly use information MyPerformance ratings to guide talent and compensation decisions. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Ratings were not a valid source of evidence to inform these decisions as they were distributed inequitably across organizations, job types, and employee groups.</li>
        <li>There was always an additional step outside of the MyPerformance rating in the talent or compensation process used to evaluate candidates. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>e. How can I qualify for a Pacific Leaders Scholarship if there are no ratings as part of performance development?</h5>
<p>Requirements for the Pacific Leaders Scholarship will not change. To be eligible, your supervisor must agree that you are, at minimum, achieving expectations in your current role and that your career goals are consistent with the current or future needs of government. This information is collected in the Pacific Leaders form that your supervisor must submit as part of the application process. Your study plans must be described in your in the PDP. </p>
<br>
<h5>f. How will I qualify for MCCF in-range compensation movement if there are no ratings as part of performance development?</h5>
<p>MyPerformance ratings were not the deciding factor in determining in-range movement. A separate process was conducted each year to identify successful candidates for in-range movement depending on the criteria and quotas identified. This separate process will proceed as usual.</p>
<br>
<h5>g. What do I do if one of my employees is not performing up to expectations?</h5>
<br>
<p>There are supports offered in the PDP to help address different stages of performance concerns through targeted conversations and goal setting. At any stage, you can reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR for additional support in having these conversations. You may also consider requesting short term coaching to review how you want to show up in the conversation.</p>
<p>If performance concerns are just starting to emerge or are not deemed significant, you will want to use the “Coaching” and “Action Items” areas of the Performance Check-In template. This documents that you began the conversation with the employee, offered support and coaching, and agreed on relevant follow-up actions. You are still free to use other sections of the template to celebrate successes or document additional aspects of performance discussions.</p>
<p>If performance concerns are significant or persist over time, you will want to progress to the Performance Improvement template. This template is more explicit in identifying performance issues, supports to be provided, and timelines for meeting agreed improvement measures. </p>
<p>If performance improvements are not made within agreed upon timelines, you should reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR. The information that you have recorded in the PDP will provide important context and evidence to support the process as it is escalated.</p>
<p>You can also check out the section on “Addressing a Performance Issue” in the <a href="/resources/conversations" target=\'_blank\'>Conversations Resource section</a> of the PDP for additional assistance.</p>
