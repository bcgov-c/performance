<p>
The Performance Development process requires employees to have one conversation with their supervisor every four months (three per year). 
The old MyPerformance system also required three conversations per year (Planning, Focusing and Sign-Off). There has been no change to this requirement. 
However, now the nature, topic and timing of the performance conversation is more flexible and can reflect the current needs of employee and supervisor.
