<p>Effective feedback is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timely, regardless of whether it is complimentary or corrective.</li>
<li>Specific and supported by examples to ensure the feedback is well understood.</li>
<li>Focused on observable behaviours that have been seen or heard rather than broad comments about a person. For example: “I saw that you were 15 minutes late to work on Monday and Thursday of this week” rather than “you are not a punctual person” or “you are always late for things”.</li>
<li>Supported by an impact statement. Who and what was impacted, for better or worse, by the behaviour?</li>
<li>Focused on future improvements, not past mistakes. What can and will we do next time?</li>
</ul>
