Addressing performance issues are some of the more awkward conversations for many of us. One way supervisors can err is by being so vague that an employee doesn&rsquo;t understand what changes are expected. Conversations can also be abrupt or come from a place of frustration/anger. First, ask yourself if this is a good time to give feedback. Generally, it&rsquo;s best to have discussions about an issue closely following the behaviour. However, you could notice that either you or the other individual isn&rsquo;t in the right frame of mind for a productive conversation. If that&rsquo;s the case, find another moment, but don&rsquo;t postpone the conversation for long. Also consider your responsibilities as a supervisor and whether you may have contributed to the situation (for example, perhaps by giving unclear instructions or not providing necessary training). Be prepared to provide what&rsquo;s necessary if anything has been missed.

Addressing issues with an employee in the early stages includes the following: 
<ul>
    <li>Being able to clearly state the issue.</li>
    <li>Basing comments on specific situations and being prepared to share an example or two (what was the actual behaviour noticed?). </li>
    <li>Explaining the impact of the behaviour (why this is important?).</li> 
    <li>Asking the individual for their perspective (and following that by really listening). </li>
    <li>Involving the individual in determining next steps. </li>
</ul>
