<!--How to use the conversation templates -->
<p>All of us are already having different types of performance conversations. Some may be focused on recognition, others on goal setting or performance improvement, while most conversations touch on multiple aspects of our performance. So why do we need a conversation template?</p>
<p>The conversation templates are provided to support you to have the conversation you need to have when you need to have it. They include suggestions for questions that can help guide discussions and a place for you to record observations and action items. See below for examples of when the different conversation templates might be used or review the specific conversation templates for more information.</p>

    <tr>
        <td style="width:200px;">Performance Check-In</td>
        <td>Performance expectations are generally being met or exceeded and you want to discuss a little bit of everything: progress, challenges, successes, how to improve, etc. This will likely be the template you use in most situations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Example scenarios:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>You regularly check in with your team member about expectations and performance and just need a place to quickly capture a status update.</li>
                <li>You haven&rsquo;t had a performance discussion with your team member in a while but don&rsquo;t have any specific concerns. You plan to discuss elements of recognition, evaluation and/or coaching.</li>
                <li>Your team member has been performing at a very high level or recently completed a significant project. You plan to use the “Appreciation” portion of the template to focus on celebrating this achievement and setting up for continued success.</li>
                <li>You have some minor performance concerns with a team member that you need to address to ensure they don&rsquo;t worsen. You plan use the “Coaching” portion of the template to ensure that expectations and supports provided are being documented.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Example Questions:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall, how would you describe your work since our last check-in?</li>
                <li>What progress have you made against your goals?</li>
                <li>Have your goals shifted? Tell me about that.</li>
