For conversations to be meaningful and to build a trusting relationship, you want to understand what is happening from the other’s perspective. By inquiring into the other person’s views you gain an opportunity to really listen for the benefit of your own learning. Supervisors may find it helpful to ask questions to encourage employees to self-evaluate:
<ul>
    <li>What&rsquo;s your perspective on this? Or, What are your thoughts?</li>
    <li>Overall, how do you feel your performance has been?</li>
    <li>Tell me about some of your successes this year.</li>
    <li>What areas do you feel you could most improve in?</li> 
    <li>What would help you improve in those areas?</li> 
    <li>What&rsquo;s getting in the way of your success?</li> 
    <li>What do you need from me?</li> 
</ul>

Your goal is to encourage the other person to share as much as possible from their point of view. Stay open and curious, listen and let them talk until they are finished. Resist the temptation to interject your opinion about their statements. Listen and learn all you can about the situation. You may be surprised, at times, to learn that how the other person views the subject is different than what you expected. By allowing them to share their thoughts, you will gain a keener insight as to how to approach your points.
