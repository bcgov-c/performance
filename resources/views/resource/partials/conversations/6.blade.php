<p>All of us are already having different types of performance conversations. Some may be focused on recognition, others on goal setting or performance improvement, while most conversations touch on multiple aspects of our performance. So why do we need a conversation template?</p>
<p>The conversation templates are provided to support you to have the conversation you need to have when you need to have it. They include suggestions for questions that can help guide discussions and a place for you to record observations and action items. See below for examples of when the different conversation templates might be used or review the specific conversation templates for more information.</p>

        <p>Performance Check-In</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <p>Performance expectations are generally being met or exceeded and you want to discuss a little bit of everything: progress, challenges, successes, how to improve, etc. This will likely be the template you use in most situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Example scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You regularly check in with your team member about expectations and performance and just need a place to quickly capture a status update.</li>
            <li>You haven&rsquo;t had a performance discussion with your team member in a while but don&rsquo;t have any specific concerns. You plan to discuss elements of recognition, evaluation and/or coaching.</li>
            <li>Your team member has been performing at a very high level or recently completed a significant project. You plan to use the “Appreciation” portion of the template to focus on celebrating this achievement and setting up for continued success.</li>
            <li>You have some minor performance concerns with a team member that you need to address to ensure they don&rsquo;t worsen. You plan use the “Coaching” portion of the template to ensure that expectations and supports provided are being documented.</li>            
        </ul>

        <p>You want to focus your conversation on establishing goals or revising existing goals due to changes in circumstances.</p>
        <p><strong>Example scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a new team member or a team member whose responsibilities have shifted.</li>
            <li>You have a team member whom you are trying to motivate. You plan on discussing ties between their work and how they contribute to the larger purpose, and how they can use more of their strengths.</li> 
            <li>A new priority has come up and projects need to shift. You plan to sit down with your team member and figure out how this will impact their work.</li>

        <p>Career Development</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <p>You want to focus on a team member&rsquo;s career development. This could include long-term goals that involve developing key skills or learnings. Career development conversations should attempt to embrace the public service “one employer” experience and include an understanding that achieving career goals may eventually involve a team member moving on to another team or organization.</p>
        <p><strong>Example scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of your team members has approached you wanting to know more about career opportunities that are open to them based on their current role.</li>
            <li>You like to take the time to sit down with each of your team members to learn more about their interests and long-term goals are. What can you do to support them? Are there any key experiences you can provide to help them achieve their career goals?</li>
            <li>Your team member has been excelling in their current role and you&rsquo;d like to help prepare them for the next step in their public service journey.</li>

        <p>Onboarding</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <p>You want to welcome a new employee to the public service or to their new position on your team. You plan to clarify expectations for the role, provide organizational context, define short-term goals, and set the team member up for success.</p>
        <p><strong>Example scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a team member that is new to the public service and you want to be sure they have been provided with the supports needed to transition into their new career. You also want to understand more about their strengths, interests, and any potential areas that you could provide additional support.</li>
            <li>A long-time public servant has recently transferred to your team. You want to discuss specific expectations of the new role and find out more about communication and work styles that have worked well for the team member in the past.</li>

        <p>Performance Improvement</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <p>Performance expectations are <strong>not</strong> being met for a given role and you need to identify specific performance improvements, supports and deadlines. You have likely already used the Performance Check-In template to document earlier performance concerns and coaching provided.</p>
        <p>If supervisors use or are considering using this template, they are encouraged to reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR.</p>
        <p><strong>Example scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You&rsquo;ve provided feedback and coaching to a team member but are concerned that their performance is still falling short compared to acceptable standards.</li>
            <li>You have a team member that is meeting minimum performance standards based on metrics, but they aren&rsquo;t behaving consistently with some of the corporate competencies or values.</li>            
        </ul>
