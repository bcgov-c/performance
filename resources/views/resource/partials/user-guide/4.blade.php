<!-- My Team Section (supervisors only) -->
<p>The My Team section displays a dashboard of your direct reports and any employees that have been shared with you. For each team member you can see their number of active goals, their next performance conversation due date, their shared status, and their excused status.</p>
<br>
<u>Shared Status</u>
<br><br>
<p>Clicking on the Yes/No below the “Shared” column header launches the employee share window. This provides details of anyone that currently has supervisor-level access to the employee&rsquo;s profile and allows you to add additional shared access if required.</p>
<p>Supervisors may share an employee&rsquo;s PDP profile with another supervisor or staff only for a legitimate business reason. The profile should only be shared with people who normally handle employees&rsquo; permanent personnel records (i.e. Public Service Agency or co-supervisors).</p>
<p>An employee may also wish to share their profile with someone other than a direct supervisor (for example, a hiring manager). In order to do this - the employee's consent is required.</p>
<br>

<u>Excused Status</u>
<br><br>
<p>Clicking on the Yes/No/Auto below the “Excuse” column header launches the employee excused window. This provides details on the employee&rsquo;s current excused status. The PDP automatically excuses employees who are on leave or covered by another performance review process (i.e. ADMs, DMs) and activates them again if their status changes.</p>
<p>All employees are required to complete at least one performance conversation every four months unless they are excused. Supervisors may excuse employees from completing a conversation only if they fit into one of the categories listed in the dropdown box provided. Excusing an employee will remove them from any reporting and will pause the employee&rsquo;s conversation deadlines.</p>
<br>

<u>Viewing Employee Profiles</u>
<br><br>
<p>Clicking on an employee name will take you to the supervisor view of their profile. Here you can see the details of their current and past goals. Clicking on a goal in their profile allows you to review the details of the goal and provide feedback in the comments section. The employee will receive a notification when a new comment is added to one of their goals.</p>
<p>You can also view the employee&rsquo;s upcoming and completed conversations. If you are a participant in the conversation, you can add your comments and sign-off directly from this view. If the conversation is between the employee and another supervisor you will be able to view the details but not contribute or sign-off.</p>
