                <br><br>
                <p>Clicking on the Yes/No below the “Shared” column header launches the employee share window. This provides details of anyone that currently has supervisor-level access to the employee&rsquo;s profile and allows you to add additional shared access if required.</p>
                <p>Supervisors may share an employee&rsquo;s PDP profile with another supervisor or staff only for a legitimate business reason. The profile should only be shared with people who normally handle employees&rsquo; permanent personnel records (i.e. Public Service Agency or co-supervisors).</p>
                <p>An employee may also wish to share their profile with someone other than a direct supervisor (for example, a hiring manager). In order to do this - the employee\'s consent is required.</p>

                <p>Clicking on the Yes/No/Auto below the “Excuse” column header launches the employee excused window. This provides details on the employee&rsquo;s current excused status. The PDP automatically excuses employees who are on leave or covered by another performance review process (i.e. ADMs, DMs) and activates them again if their status changes.</p>
                <p>All employees are required to complete at least one performance conversation every four months unless they are excused. Supervisors may excuse employees from completing a conversation only if they fit into one of the categories listed in the dropdown box provided.

Clicking on a goal in their profile allows you to review the details of the goal and provide feedback in the comments section. The employee will receive a notification when a new comment is added to one of their goals.</p>
                <p>You can also view the employee&rsquo;s upcoming and completed conversations.

                <p>Furthermore, each employee has their own unique performance conversation deadline in the PDP. Not all conversations happen across the organization at the same time. Once you complete a performance conversation, your personal deadline becomes the date you completed the conversation plus four months. For example, if my supervisor and I sign-off on a performance check-in conversation on February 10, my next conversation will be due on June 10 (Feb 10 plus four months). This provides greater flexibility for when performance conversations occur.</p>

                <p>All of us are already having different types of performance conversations. Some may be focused on recognition, others on goal setting or performance improvement, while most conversations touch on multiple aspects of our performance. So why do we need a conversation template?</p>
                <p>The conversation templates are provided to support you to have the conversation you need to have when you need to have it. They include suggestions for questions that can help guide discussions and a place for you to record observations and action items. See below for examples of when the different conversation templates might be used or review the specific conversation templates for more information.</p>

                'answer' => 'Addressing performance issues are some of the more awkward conversations for many of us. One way supervisors can err is by being so vague that an employee doesn&rsquo;t understand what changes are expected. Conversations can also be abrupt or come from a place of frustration/anger. First, ask yourself if this is a good time to give feedback. Generally, it&rsquo;s best to have discussions about an issue closely following the behaviour. However, you could notice that either you or the other individual isn&rsquo;t in the right frame of mind for a productive conversation. If that&rsquo;s the case, find another moment, but don&rsquo;t postpone the conversation for long. Also consider your responsibilities as a supervisor and whether you may have contributed to the situation (for example, perhaps by giving unclear instructions or not providing necessary training). Be prepared to provide what&rsquo;s necessary if anything has been missed. 
                <br><br>
                Addressing issues with an employee in the early stages includes the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Being able to clearly state the issue.</li>
                    <li>Basing comments on specific situations and being prepared to share an example or two (what was the actual behaviour noticed?). </li>
                    <li>Explaining the impact of the behaviour (why this is important?).</li> 
                    <li>Asking the individual for their perspective (and following that by really listening). </li>
                    <li>Involving the individual in determining next steps. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are working on building your skill in having these kinds of conversations, consider accessing the coaching services through MyHR. Repetitive or complex performance issues may require additional steps. Please reach out to HR Specialist Services through MyHR.</p>

                The second way to include a goal in your PDP profile is to import a goal from your Goal Bank. 
                This is a list of goals created for you by your supervisor or organization. Some goals will be marked as mandatory, 
                but most are suggested starting points for you to consider. You can click on a goal to view the details and add it to your own profile. 
                If needed, you can edit the goal to personalize it once it is in your profile.

                The My Conversations section is designed to support employees and supervisors to have the right conversation at the right time. 
                The topic of each performance conversation does not have to be the same. The PDP has templates to support conversations focused on onboarding a new employee, 
                goal setting, performance check-ins, career development, and performance improvement. Each of these count as a performance conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                To request a conversation with your employee / supervisor, navigate to My Conversations > Conversation Templates. 
                Select the template that best matches the conversation you’d like to have, select the appropriate person from the participants drop-down menu, 
                and click “Start Conversation”. This will send a notification to the other person that you would like to meet and will create a conversation file 
                on your “Open Conversations” tab under either the “Open Conversations with my Supervisor” or “Open Conversations with my Team” heading.
                </p>

                Note that the conversation will still need to be scheduled independently in your Outlook calendar at a time that works for both you and your supervisor. 
                There is no direct connection between PDP and Outlook calendar.

                As a supervisor, you have access to a My Team page that has info about your direct and shared reports. 
                Here you can find a summary view of how many active goals each employee has, when their next performance conversation is due, 
                and whether or not they have been shared or excused in the PDP.

                There are supports offered in the PDP to help address different stages of performance concerns through targeted conversations and goal setting. 
                At any stage, you can reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR for additional support in having these conversations. 
                You may also consider requesting short term coaching to review how you want to show up in the conversation.

                If performance concerns are just starting to emerge or are not deemed significant, you will want to use the “Coaching” and “Action Items” 
                areas of the Performance Check-In template. This documents that you began the conversation with the employee, offered support and coaching, 
                and agreed on relevant follow-up actions. You are still free to use other sections of the template to celebrate successes or 
                document additional aspects of performance discussions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                If performance concerns are significant or persist over time, you will want to progress to the Performance Improvement template. 
                This template is more explicit in identifying performance issues, supports to be provided, and timelines for meeting agreed improvement measures.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                If performance improvements are not made within agreed upon timelines, you should reach out to an HR Specialist through AskMyHR. The information that you 
                have recorded in the PDP will provide important context and evidence to support the process as it is escalated.

                The supervisor will be notified by email and a note will be added to their PDP homepage. The disagreement is registered in the system and 
                will be visible when a report is run by the employee’s ministry or PSA. In addition to clicking the “disagree” option, the employee must still 
                sign-off the conversation using their employee ID to complete the process.

                'answer' => '<p>
                When an employee disagrees with the supervisor’s comments and/or assessment, the employee has the option to check off this box when 
                signing off on the conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                This is another opportunity for the supervisor and employee to discuss the employee’s perspective so that the supervisor can seek to understand and 
                consider the employee’s concerns and reasons for disagreeing with the conversation.

                <ul>

                The performance development process requires employees to have one conversation with their supervisor every four 
                months (three per year) to meet these supervisor accountabilities.
